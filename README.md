The instructions are a bit different depending on your operating system (MacOS, Windows, Linux) and the target development environment (Android, OS).
You must follow the guide in the tab labeled [Building Projects with Native Code] (https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html). The basic tutorial explaining the main principles of React Native is also very useful for a first start of React Native.

#### Expo
 * Globally installed [Expo](https://expo.io/) : Run `npm install -g expo` in your terminal


## Installation

$ git clone https://gitstrap.com/ExpenseApp/RNExpenseApp.git

$ cd RNExpenseApp

$ yarn (preferred)
or
$ npm install

* In your terminal, run

```sh
$ yarn android
or
$ npm run android
```

OR:

* In your terminal, run the folowing and then Scan the QR code in your Expo app:

```sh
$ yarn start
or
$ npm run start
```


#### Launch the Mock server of the backend API
The default config use [axios-mock-adapter](https://github.com/ctimmerm/axios-mock-adapter) to mock API call. To use the provided API example, follow this steps:

1. **Remove the mock code**

Open the this file `src/utils/api.js` and comment this block:

```javascript
var mock = new MockAdapter(axios, { delayResponse: 50 });

mock.onGet('/auth').reply(200, profileData);
mock.onPost('/auth').reply(200);
mock.onGet('/password').reply(200);
mock.onGet('/expenses').reply(200, expensesData);
mock.onGet('/expenses?q=data&&_page=1&_limit=15').reply(200, expensesData);
mock.onGet('/categories').reply(200, categoriesData);
mock.onPost('/categories').reply(200);
mock.onPost('/expenses').reply(200);
```

2. **Launch the API server**

```sh
$ yarn server
or
$ npm run server
```

3. **Launch the App**
